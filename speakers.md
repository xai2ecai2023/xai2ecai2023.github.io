**Explanation Capabilities of Bayesian Networks in Dynamic Industrial Domains**

> This talk will describe how Bayesian network models can provide natural explanations in temporal domains from the industry.  After a brief introduction to Bayesian networks in static settings, discrete-time versions for temporal domains will be presented, which include dynamic Bayesian networks and the popular hidden Markov models. The more recent continuous time Bayesian networks and their supervised classification counterparts, both in uni- and multi-dimensional settings, will be explained. How Bayesian networks can be used in dynamic clustering will also be covered. In all cases real examples from industry will illustrate the versatile capabilities of Bayesian networks to intrinsically explain the model as a  whole, predictions (reasoning), instances (evidences) and decisions. This is the so-called XBN framework, that encourages efficient communication with end users, supports understanding of how and why certain predicitions were made, gaining new industrial insights.
